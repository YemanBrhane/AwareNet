# AwareNet: Cell abundance aware deep learning for cell detection on highly imbalanced pathological data

## Description
In this work, we proposed a new class balancing approach in the context of single cell detection from single cell dot annotation.
Our work has the following contributions:
1) We implemented cell detection and classification deep learning framework that uses class balancing technique of Dice overlap in dataset with class imbalance.
2)We implemented an algorithm that generates cells
weight image from expert dot annotation based on the
relative abundance of cell types in the training data.
3) We implemented and compared performance of different
cell weighting strategies.

It is published in ISBI 2020 and the full manuscript is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9433994).
